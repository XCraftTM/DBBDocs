## Switch Workspaces

Workspaces are important parts of making a Bot, as they allow you
to split parts of the Bot to make it visually more appealing and easier to find things you created.

## Manage Workspaces

You can manage any Workspace, by using your Right Mouse Click Button on a Workspace in the left Sidebar.  
That opens a Editor View like a User Profile on Discord.

This allows you to change the Name, Profile Color and Banner Image.  
As well as setting a description/note for the workspace for when you share it.
