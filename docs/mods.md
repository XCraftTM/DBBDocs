=== "Manual Way"
    ## Downloading
    :   You need to Download the blocks from the `currently` official DBB Block Storage Website.  
        [Download All Blocks :fontawesome-solid-download:](https://blocks.dbb.software/Blocks/!allBlocks.zip){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
        [Storage Server :fontawesome-solid-link:](https://blocks.dbb.software/Blocks/){ .md-button target="_blank"}
    
    ### Dragging into the Blocks Folder
    :   After Downloading the ZIP File of all the Blocks or just one Block file,
        you need to open your Project folder and then Drag the Block file into the Blocks folder.
        The ZIP file has to be extracted into the Blocks Folder.
