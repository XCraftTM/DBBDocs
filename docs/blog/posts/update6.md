**Big Overhaul of the Documentation**

:   I have overhauled the hosting of the Images for the Documentations
    And also we now have a new Slash Commands Documentation, now including the User-Installable Commands.

<!-- more -->

**About the new Images**

:   A few people from countries like Russia or further had issues reading the images 
    that are displayed on the Documentation cause they were hosted on Imgur, which is blocked in those regions.

:   With that i have now changed that so the images now are on the GitHub Repo to be able to see them properly.

**New Slash Commands Page**

:   I have also Overhauled the Slash Commands Page to make it a bit easier to understand and find what you are looking for.

:   Now the Pages and steps are split into individual Content Tabs which makes it a bit easier to read.

**Hoping for your Feedback**

:   If you have some ideas for the Documentation or other things that you would like changed, be sure to reach out to me!
