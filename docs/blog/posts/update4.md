**Slash Command Builder Overhaul**

:   As apart of this re-work, I have also completed an overhaul of the 
    [slash command builder](https://github.com/bsati/dc-app-command-builder){ target=_blank }
    that was previously embeded within the docs, improving the finctionality and apperance, 
    allowing you to now create your slash commands from the official documents themselves.
