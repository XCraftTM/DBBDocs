This Part will Explain how to install/add Workspaces from our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/PAzxTDw){:target="_blank"}.

=== "Written"

    In the Workspaces Channel on the DBB Discord, there you can find a txt file with the JSON Code for the Workspace.
    :   * Download the `.txt` file
        * Copy the contents of the file
        * Open DBB, load a project, create a new Workspace and right click it
        * Then Press the Cyan Colored Paste Button
        * Press `Paste` on the Warning that pops up
        * Done, you have now added a Workspace to your Project!

    (Note: You may need Custom Modded Blocks that should be mentioned in the Thread)
